<h1>About</h1>
<p><img src="CCSD Logo 2019.png" width="200" height="203" alt=""/>I am a driven and passionate individual with a strong background in education and a desire to make a positive impact in the lives of others. With over six years of experience working for the District, I have developed a deep understanding of the unique challenges and opportunities that come with serving students, teachers, and staff members.</p>
<p>Throughout my time at the District, I have worked in a variety of roles, including as a Print Shop Technician and in Public Relations, where I have been able to help students, teachers, and staff members achieve their goals and promote a positive image of the district. I am proud of the work that I have accomplished so far, and I am eager to continue growing and developing my skills in the field of education.</p>
<p>As a Public Relations supervisor working in the school district, I possess a strong set of skills that enable me to effectively communicate with staff, parents, and the community. I have experience in creating and implementing communication strategies, managing social media accounts, developing press releases, and organizing events. Additionally, I have excellent writing and editing skills, as well as experience with graphic design and video production. I am confident in my ability to effectively represent the district and promote a positive image to all stakeholders involved.</p>
