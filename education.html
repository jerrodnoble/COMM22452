<h1>Education</h1>
<p>I am proud to have completed my high school education at Kirtland Central High School, where I learned the importance of hard work, dedication, and perseverance. During my time there, I participated in a variety of extracurricular activities, including the school's newspaper, where I discovered my passion for journalism and writing.</p>
<p>After graduating from high school, I decided to continue my education at San Juan College, where I obtained my Associates degree in Liberal Arts. During my time at San Juan College, I took a variety of courses, including English, history, and psychology, which helped me to develop a well-rounded understanding of the world and different disciplines.</p>
<p>My education background has equipped me with a strong foundation in the liberal arts and a passion for communication. Currently, I am pursuing a career in public relations, where I am excited to use my skills and knowledge to help organizations communicate effectively with their target audience. </p>
<p>I believe that effective communication is key to building strong relationships with stakeholders and promoting positive brand image. As a public relations professional, I am committed to ensuring that my clients' messages are delivered in a clear, concise, and compelling manner. </p>
<p>Overall, my education and experience have prepared me well for a successful career in public relations, and I am excited to continue learning and growing in this field.</p>
